<h3>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>
Our Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.
You can find out further information about the rules on data transfers outside the EEA, including the mechanisms that we rely upon, on the European Commission website here <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection_en</a>.</p>
<h4>1.3 General exceptions</h4><p>
If we are required to intercept, disclose, monitor and/or store your Personal Information:<br>
    • by law;<br>
    • to conduct our business;<br>
    • to secure our systems; or<br>
    • to enforce our own rights, we will do so in the manner as prescribed by legislation.<br>
Such interception, disclosure, monitoring and storage may take place without your knowledge. In that case, we will not be liable to you or any third party for any damages howsoever arising from such interception, disclosure, monitoring and storage.<br>
In order to ensure that all our Users comply with the User Rules, we may monitor your Personal Information to the extent that this may be required to determine compliance and/or to identify instances of non-compliance.<br>
To ensure that the security and integrity of our Services are safeguarded, we may monitor your Personal Information. This monitoring may include (without limitation) the filtering of incoming and outgoing electronic data messages to identify, limit and/or prevent the transmission of spam, viruses and/or unlawful, defamatory, obscene or otherwise undesirable material or content.<br><br>
We may under certain circumstances procure an element of the Services from a third party service provider; for example we may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Website. To the extent that it may be necessary, and solely for the purposes of providing the Service to you, you agree that we may disclose to such third party any of your Personal Information that may be necessary for the procurement of services from the third party. These companies may also use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. More information about this practice and your choices about not having this information used by these companies would be available with the respective third parties. Also, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>choicesfor information on how to opt-out of the use of such technologies for the delivery of more relevant advertising.</p><br>
<p>
<h5>Data we use with your consent</h5>
We collect, store and use your email address, if you have provided your consent, in order to send to you promotional offers and provide marketing for Services that we believe may be of interest to you (see below for details of our marketing communications). We also use your data to offer you other Services which we think may be of interest to you by email where you have given your consent. You can withdraw your consent for these email communications at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our emails.<br>
On our apps, some of the third party advertising companies that we work with also collect, use and store data about you with your consent when you access and use our Services in order to provide you with targeted advertising. You can withdraw your consent for targeted advertising on our apps at any point using the privacy settings available on our apps. (On our websites, you can choose to disable targeted advertising at any point using your privacy settings on our websites. Note however that we will still serve you advertising when you visit or use our websites but this will no longer be tailored to you or your preferences). For more details on our relationship with third party advertising companies, please see the section below titled 'Third party advertising companies'.<br>
Anonymous data<br>
We will also collect anonymised details about visitors to and use of our Services for the purposes of creating aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.<br>
If you have provided your consent, we may send you marketing communications in relation to our other Services that we think may be of interest to you via email. These messages will only ever be in relation to the named other similar Services of Gamasome Interactive that you have provided your consent to receive. We do not provide your data to third parties so that they can send you direct marketing communications via email or push notification without first obtaining your consent. Please also see the section below regarding third party advertising for more information about advertising activities on our Services involving third parties.<br>
You can opt-out of receiving any direct marketing communications that we (or any third party to whom we have disclosed your personal information with your consent) may send you by using the unsubscribe mechanism in those marketing emails, or, in relation to push notifications, by choosing not to accept them or by turning them off by visiting the settings on your device and selecting the appropriate setting.<br>
<h5>Data Protection</h5>
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.<br>
We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. For example, your email address and password will be encrypted which will make it very difficult for someone to discover and use them without our authorisation. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function which requires them to access and use your data in order to supply you with our Services. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods to ensure we continue to protect your data.<br>
Whilst we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us over the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of data during its transfer over the Internet to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorised access.<br>
<h5>Data Retention</h5>
We will keep data only for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was originally collected and otherwise where required by law. This means that we will only retain your data for the minimum reasonable time period to allow us to provide our Services to you. If you decide to delete an account you have with us, certain data does stay on our Gamasome Interactive system for administrative purposes and to defend or bring any legal action.<br>

<h5>Privacy for Children</h5>

Most of our Services are not specifically targeted at children. Where the Services are being used by children under the age of 16, we recommend parents and guardians regularly clear their browser cache and/or browsing history to clear cookies.<br>
For some Services however it may be possible for those under the age of 16 to register an account and access games and other content (with parental or guardian consent). Where children under 16 sign up and use our Services, their account is limited to those aspects of the Services which we deem appropriate for children.<br>
<h6>If you are under 16 and have signed up to use any of our Services, we will only collect and process the following limited data about you:</h6><br>
•	your date of birth and email address. We collect, use and store this data as it is necessary in order to allow you to log-in and use the Services you have registered for. We need to use your date of birth to make sure that users are not attempting to access Services which we deem inappropriate; and<br>
